### 🧱 Foundation Assessment
- 🚧 **Constraint Issues:**

    - missing_not_null: phone, address, city, state, zip_code, country, registration_date, last_purchase_date, total_spent, customer_segment, age, gender, acquisition_channel, lifecycle_stage, clv_score, churn_risk_score, preferred_category, communication_preference

    - missing_default_values: 

    - missing_unique_constraints: 

- 📝 **Naming Violations:**

    - columns_not_snake_case: 

    - reserved_keywords_used: 

- ⚠️ **Datatype Warnings:**

    - Column 'phone' uses TEXT instead of VARCHAR(15)

    - Column 'total_spent' uses DECIMAL(10,2) but should ensure it's defined consistently

- 🧱 **Architecture Findings:**

    - Consider adding foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity

    - Column 'email' is unique but no other columns are indexed, consider indexing frequently queried fields.

    - Review nullable columns and add NOT NULL constraints where appropriate for mandatory fields

### 🧠 AI Recommendations
- **Data Quality**
  - Implement **NOT NULL** constraints on the following columns: `phone`, `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, `country`, `registration_date`, `last_purchase_date`, `total_spent`, `customer_segment`, `age`, `gender`, `acquisition_channel`, `lifecycle_stage`, `clv_score`, `churn_risk_score`, `preferred_category`, and `communication_preference` to ensure completeness.
  - Apply **data masking** for PII columns: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone`, `address`, `city`, and `zip_code` to comply with data privacy regulations.

- **Schema Design**
  - Refactor the schema to normalize tables if necessary by analyzing potential duplicate data, especially focusing on `customer_segment`, `acquisition_channel`, and `preferred_category`.
  - Amend the datatype for the `phone` column from **TEXT** to **VARCHAR(15)** to accurately reflect its purpose and improve validation.

- **Indexing & Performance**
  - Add indexes for frequently queried columns that currently lack them, especially `registration_date`, `last_purchase_date`, and other high-volume categorical fields to improve query performance.
  - Review existing indexing strategies, particularly ensuring that any column with a unique constraint like `email` is indexed for faster lookups.

- **Governance & Compliance**
  - Document table purpose and column definitions to enhance team understanding and governance, ensuring that all team members have a clear reference for data usage.
  - Consider adding **foreign key constraints** for better referential integrity in relationships as opportunities arise in future expansions of the dataset.
