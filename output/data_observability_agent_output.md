Observability Blueprint for 'customers' Table

1. Monitoring Query Logs and Performance:
   - Log all query execution times, frequencies, and potential errors for auditing and performance tracking.
   - Aggregate query performance metrics for insights into potential bottlenecks.

2. Anomaly Detection and Schema Change Alerts:
   - Set up real-time anomaly detection for key metrics like 'total_spent', 'registration_date', and 'age'.
   - Schema drift alerts to be activated on changes to the table structure, such as type changes or required fields being altered.

3. SLAs and Freshness Guarantees:
   - SLA tracking indicating that all customer data records must be updated within 30 days. 
   - Freshness check indicating data must be refreshed daily. The last updated timestamp was 2025-07-13, ensuring alerting if updates are not made since then.

4. Actionable Insights:
   - Create alerts for when data freshness goes beyond the stipulated thresholds (more than 30 days since the last update).
   - Schedule monthly reviews of data quality metrics to ensure continuous improvement.

5. Propose Observability Dashboards:
   - Dashboard to visualize the data quality score over time, breakdown of data anomalies, freshness status, and SLAs adherence level.
   - Separate dashboards for operational insights focusing on data usage patterns.

By implementing this observability framework, we can ensure the reliability and quality of the data contained within the 'customers' table while swiftly addressing any issues that may arise.
