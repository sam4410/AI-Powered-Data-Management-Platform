# ETL Integration Design Document

## Overview
This document defines the ETL strategy for merging data across systems with a focus on data quality, deduplication logic, and sync workflows.

## Assessment of Tables
- **Sales**
  - Record Count: 75,306
  - Quality Score: 0.952
  - Issues Identified: Nulls in `salesperson_id`, duplicates in ID fields.

- **Employees**
  - To be assessed similarly for integration readiness.

## Workflows

### Join Strategy
- Use INNER JOIN for relationships between sales and order systems based on foreign keys.
- Use LEFT JOIN for optional data from related tables like employees.

### Deduplication Strategy
- Identify and remove duplicates based on unique identifiers in the `sales` table.
- Regularly audit data to uphold uniqueness and completeness.

### Transformation Logic
- Transform date formats and currency values to standardize datasets.
- Derive total values for financial integrity and performance metrics.

## Synchronization Strategy
- **Batch Processing**: Nightly data sync for historical data consolidation.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Streaming updates for transaction-level changes.

## Conclusion
Following this ETL strategy will ensure high-quality, deduplicated data integration across all systems.
