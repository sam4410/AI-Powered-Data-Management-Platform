#### 2. Security Measures and Access Controls
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users only have access to the data they need.
- Use encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- Regularly audit access logs for any unauthorized access attempts.

#### 3. Backup and Disaster Recovery Mechanisms
- Schedule daily backups of all databases to secure storage.
- Implement a disaster recovery plan that includes a recovery point objective (RPO) and a recovery time objective (RTO) of no more than 4 hours.

#### 4. Data Governance Frameworks and Policies
- Define data governance policies that include data quality standards, data lifecycle policies, and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Appoint a Data Steward for overseeing data management and compliance.

#### 5. Monitoring and Alerting Systems
- Set up monitoring tools to check database performance, query latency, and system health.
- Implement alerts for critical issues such as failed connections, slow queries, or potential data breaches.

#### 6. Documentation of the Complete Infrastructure Setup
- Maintain a comprehensive document that details the configuration of the databases, connections, security measures, operational procedures, and governance policies.
